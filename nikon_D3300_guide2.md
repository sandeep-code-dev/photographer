#### Raw File Format.

- Raw image data is saved directly from the image sensor. This means RAW files must be processed on the computer before they are printed.
- Raw files are larger than JPEG files.
- Raw files have much broaded range of tones. shadow and high light areas have more details than other image files.
- You can extensively edit RAW files without losing any image data.

#### JPEG File Format.

- JPEG files are standard compressed files format that are supported by any image software.
- Becuase they are compressed they are very small comapred to RAW files. As a result they have narrower range of tones and loose some image data each time they are saved.

here you can choose between

- Matrix metering - Its general use metering mode. That can be used in most shooting scenarios. When this mode is selected the camera will divide the scene into zones. Then the camera measure and highlights in each zone and averages all of the zones, then the camera uses that average to set the exposure automatically to suit the scene. This is good use for many situations but when the scene is very bright or dark you may want to use different metering mode.
  ![matrix selection](./nikon_D3300_guide_pictures/meteringMode.png)
- Center-weighted metering - It is much like matrix metering mode with zones being evaluated and averaged. With center metering the zones that are center area of the frame are given the greatest weight, the zones that are outside of the the center area of the frame are taken into account as well but these given much less priority when determining the exposure. These center weighted metering is a classic mdoe used for portraits.
  ![matrix selection](./nikon_D3300_guide_pictures/centerWeightedMode.png)
- Spot metering- It works almost the same way as the center weighted metering but spot metering uses only 2.5% of the frame to determine proper exposure. When spot metering is used on the D3300 the area that is used to meter exposure is the center of the selected focus point this feature is easier to meter off center subjects spot metering is a great mode to use when there is lot of contrast between the background and the subject when the background is either very bright or very dark.
